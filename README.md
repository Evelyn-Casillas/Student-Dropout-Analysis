## Student Exam Scores Prediction  
This repository contains the final project for the ANA 500: Python for Data Science course at National University. The goal of this project is to predict student outcomes, specifically whether a student will pass or fail based on their exam scores. Understanding the factors that influence exam scores can help identify students at risk of failing, enabling early intervention and support.

**Project Introduction and Objective**  
The objective of this project is to use machine learning techniques to predict student success based on historical exam score data. By analyzing the data, we aim to uncover insights that could assist educational institutions in identifying students who may need additional resources or intervention to improve their performance.

**Methodology**  
To achieve the goal of predicting student outcomes, the following steps were implemented:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the raw data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize the data to identify trends, patterns, and potential relationships between exam scores and other variables.
Data Visualizations: Create visual representations of the data to gain insights and communicate findings.
Predictive Modeling: Apply machine learning models to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their exam scores.

**Technologies and Tools Used**  
Python (Jupyter Notebooks) for data analysis and modeling.
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation.
Matplotlib for data visualization.
Scikit-Learn for building and evaluating machine learning models.

**Models Used**  
Logistic Regression: A classification model used to predict binary outcomes, such as pass/fail.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classification model used to separate data into different classes.

**Dataset**  
The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle and contains historical exam scores along with additional features that may influence a student's exam results.

**Getting Started**  
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-exam-scores-prediction.git
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook to start the analysis:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
The raw data can be found in the repository, or you can download it directly from Kaggle.
